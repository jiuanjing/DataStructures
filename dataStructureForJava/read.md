# DataStructures For Java
* Array(Ordered array)
    1. unordered arrays offers fast insertion but slow searching and deleting.
    2. a binary search can be applied to an ordered array.
    3. The logarithm to the base B of a number A is (roughly) the number of times you can
       divide A by B before the result is less than 1.
    4. Linear searches require time proportional to the number of items in an array.
    5. Binary searches require time proportional to the logarithm of the number of items.
    6. Big O notation provides a convenient way to compare the speed on algorithms.
    7. An algorithm that runs in O(1) times is the best,O(log N) is good,O(N) is 
       fair ,and O(N^2) is pretty bad.
